2 : - Debian provides the largest and most complete software repository to its users of any Linux distribution. True or False?
    Answer : -(true)
    Debian is well-known for having one of the largest and most complete software repositories among all Linux distributions.
    It includes tens of thousands of packages, covering almost every category of open-source software — from desktop tools to server applications.
    Many other distributions (like Ubuntu) are even based on Debian and use its repositories as a foundation.

3 : -Fedora serves as a downstream testing platform for RHEL. True or False?
    Answer : -(false)
    Fedora actually serves as an upstream testing and development platform for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) — not downstream.
    That means:
    New features and updates are introduced and tested first in Fedora.
    Once they are stable and mature, they are then integrated into RHEL.

4 : -The Red Hat distribution family includes which of the following (Select all answers that apply)

    Answer : -
    The Red Hat distribution family includes:
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) — the commercial version.
    Fedora — the upstream community version (where new features are tested).
    CentOS — the downstream version (a free, RHEL-compatible distribution).
    The others are not part of the Red Hat family:
    Ubuntu → belongs to the Debian family.
    SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) and openSUSE → belong to the SUSE family.
